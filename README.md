# Migrate Mate - Subscription Cancellation Flow Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a fully functional subscription cancellation flow for Migrate Mate, implemented with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. The implementation features a deterministic A/B testing system, comprehensive security measures, and pixel-perfect UI fidelity.

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure
- **CancellationFlow**: Main orchestrator managing flow state and transitions
- **ConfirmCancellation**: Initial confirmation step with user verification
- **DownsellOffer**: A/B variant B component offering $10 discount
- **ReasonSelection**: Feedback collection with predefined and custom options
- **CancellationComplete**: Final step with different outcomes based on user choice

### State Management
- Centralized flow state using React hooks
- Deterministic A/B variant assignment based on user ID hash
- Persistent cancellation records in Supabase database

### Database Design
- Enhanced `cancellations` table with proper relationships
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Comprehensive tracking of user decisions and feedback

## Security Implementation

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Cancellation records are user-scoped
- Subscription updates require proper authentication

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Type-safe interfaces for all user inputs
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- CSRF protection with secure token generation

### Data Protection
- Sensitive operations require user verification
- Secure handling of cancellation reasons
- Audit trail for all cancellation activities

## A/B Testing Approach

### Deterministic Assignment
- Variant assignment based on cryptographic hash of user ID
- 50/50 split maintained consistently across sessions
- No re-randomization on return visits

### Variant Implementation
- **Variant A**: Direct path to reason selection (no downsell)
- **Variant B**: $10 discount offer ($25→$15, $29→$19)
- Persistent variant storage in database

### Data Collection
- Tracks variant assignment, user decisions, and outcomes
- Enables analysis of conversion rates and user behavior
- Supports future optimization of retention strategies

## Key Features

### Progressive Flow
- Multi-step cancellation journey with clear navigation
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- Smooth transitions between flow states

### User Experience
- Clear messaging and visual hierarchy
- Intuitive navigation with back/forward controls
- Comprehensive feedback collection

### Data Persistence
- Complete cancellation lifecycle tracking
- Subscription status management
- User feedback and reason analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React 19 with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI
- Component-based architecture for maintainability

### Backend
- Supabase for database and authentication
- PostgreSQL with proper indexing and constraints
- RESTful API design for data operations

### Security
- Comprehensive input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cancel-flow-task-main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Update with your Supabase credentials
   ```

4. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Database Schema

### Users Table
- Primary user information and authentication
- Email-based identification system

### Subscriptions Table
- Active subscription details and pricing
- Status tracking (active, pending_cancellation, cancelled)

### Cancellations Table
- Complete cancellation lifecycle data
- A/B variant assignment and user decisions
- Feedback collection and analysis

## Testing & Validation

### A/B Testing
- Deterministic variant assignment verified
- Consistent user experience across sessions
- Data integrity maintained throughout flow

### Security Testing
- RLS policies validated
- Input sanitization verified
- CSRF protection confirmed

### User Experience
- Mobile and desktop responsiveness tested
- Flow navigation validated
- Error handling verified

## Future Enhancements

### Analytics Integration
- Conversion rate tracking
- User behavior analysis
- A/B test performance metrics

### Payment Processing
- Stripe integration for downsell acceptance
- Automated billing adjustments
- Payment method validation

### User Communication
- Email notifications for status changes
- SMS reminders for pending cancellations
- In-app messaging system

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS utilities
- Minimal bundle size through code splitting

## Security Best Practices

- Principle of least privilege for database access
- Input validation at multiple layers
- Secure token generation and validation
- Comprehensive error handling without information leakage

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly cancellation flow that effectively implements A/B testing while maintaining data integrity and user privacy.
